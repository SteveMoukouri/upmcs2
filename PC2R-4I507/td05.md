### Rappels - canaux synchrones
```ocaml
new_channel
receive : 'a channel -> 'a event
send: 'a channel -> 'a -> unit event
sync: 'a event -> 'a
```
### Ex1. Mobilité - Vente en ligne
#### Q1.
Cf. feuille de TD.

Types des canaux:
* n: string channel
* c1, c2: string channel channel
* i: (string, string channel channel) channel
* s: (string, string channel) channel

#### Q2.
##### Vendeur (S)
```ocaml
let rec vendeur n =
    let (chan, prod) = sync (receive c_vendeur) in
        sync (send chan (prod ^ " " ^ (string_of_int n)));
    vendeur (n + 1)
```
##### Intermédiaire (I)
```ocaml
let chan_broker = new_channel ();;
let chan_seller = new_channel ();;

let rec intermediaire () =
    let (x, chan_buyer) = sync (receive chan_broker)
    and nu_c = new_channel () in
        sync(send chan_seller (nu_c, x));
        sync(send chan_buyer nu_c);
    intermediaire ()
```
##### Client (Cx)
```ocaml
let rec buyer args =
    let (a, n, c_buy, log, varlog) = args in
    if n == 0 then varlog := log else
    begin
        sync (send c_brok (a, c_buy))
        let chan = sync (receive c_buy) in
        let prod = sync (receive chan) in
        buyer (a, n-1, c_buy, log^prod^"\n", varlog)
    end
```

##### Main
```ocaml
let c_sell = new_channel ()
and c_brok = new_channel ()
and c_buy1 = new_channel ()
and c_buy2 = new_channel ()
and log1 = ref ""
and log2 = ref "";;

let main () =
    let _ = Thread.create seller 0 in
    let _ = Thread.create broker ()
    and t1 = Thread.create buyer ("thé", 3, c_buy1, log1)
    and t2 = Thread.create buyer ("café", 4, c_buy1, log1) in
    print_end_line !log1
    print_end_line !log2
```

### Ex2.

```ocaml
let rec work (str, chan, n) =
    if n < max then
        Thread.delay (float_of_int (3+(Random_int 10))) /. 5.0
        let _ = sync (send chan str^" "^(string_of_int n)) in
        work str chan (n+1)
    else ()

let rec consumer () =
    let x = select [receive c_p, receive c_b, receive c_o] in
    print_end_line x;
    consumer ()
```

### Ex6. Futurs
```ocaml
type 'a' future = ('a channel * bool ref)

let spawn f arg =
    let c = new_channel ()
    and isdone = ref false in
    let run_future () =
        let res = f arg in
        isdone := true
        sync (send c res)
    in
    Thread.create run_future ();
    (c, isdone)

let isDone future =
    !(fst future)

let get future =
    sync (receive (snd future))
```
